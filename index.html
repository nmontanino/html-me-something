                <p>The Great Emu War was a nuisance wildlife management military operation undertaken in Australia over the latter part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus said to be running amok in the Campion district of Western Australia.</p>
                <p>The emus won.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Following the long hot summer of 1932, wild emus in the Murchison district of Western Australia went on the rampage in search of food and water. In a bid to stop the advancing emus along the rabbit-proof fence farmers enlisted the help of the army. Armed with Lewis machine guns and 10,000 rounds, a party, led by Major Meredith of the Royal Australian Artillery, was sent to the Campion district where it was estimated 20,000 emus were causing damage. </p>
                <p>In November of 1932, the Ministry of War heeded the farmers' calls, sending in two regiments of soldiers, machine guns, and 10,000 rounds of ammo to defeat the enemy. Eradicating the flightless birds was now an official military campaign.
