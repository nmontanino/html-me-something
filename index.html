                <h3>The Great Emu War was a nuisance wildlife management military operation undertaken in Australia over the latter part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus said to be running amok in the Campion district of Western Australia.</h3>
                <h3>The emus won.</h3>
                <h3>What follows is a firsthand account of the Great Emu War, written by Lt. Tallstrider, an emu soldier serving on the front lines. This is his story.</h3>

                    <h2>September, 1932:</h2>
                    <h3>A historic drought leads the inland emu hordes toward human lands in search of food.</h3>
                    <p>Following the long hot summer of ’32, supplies had grown scarce and thousands of my Emu brethren were on the verge of starvation. By late August, the Emu high command gave the orders that we would march inland towards human settlements in order to occupy farmlands rich in food supply. By September, the Emu army was 20,000 strong and moving in to reclaim the territory that our ancestors had once roamed freely. No longer would we be subjugated by the wire fences constructed by the human oppressors.</p>

                    <h2>Early October, 1932:</h2>
                    <h3>Australian farmers are driven from thier homes by battalions of ravenous emus.</h3>
                    
                    <h4><i>"The enemy is the tough, prolific, gangling marauder of the sand plains whose species...has invaded, in a frenzy of hunger, some of the finest fields at the time of ripening of the harvest to shear off crops with voracious beaks." </i></h4>
                    <h4>-The Sunday Herald (Some Aussie Newspaper)</h4>
                    <p>The occupation of human territory was swift, and thus far proven successful. The enemy has been publishing propaganda demonizing us as frenzied marauders whose sole purpose is to inflict a scorched earth policy against their homesteads. Need I remind them that these lands were once ours before we were driven out into the inhospitable plains? It was only a matter of time before this rebellion came to fruition.</p>

                    <h2>Late October, 1932:</h2>
                    <h3>A Royal Australian artillery detachment, armed with Lewis machine guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition is sent to retake the occupied farms.</h3>
                    <p>The occupation continues. The enemy inhabitants have pleaded to their superiors as we continue to set up supply lines to desperate Emu families. Word has it that some bigshot from the human military named Merideth is commanding a small division to attempt to reclaim the land that we currently occupy. High Emu command has ordered several of our battalions in a defensive position along the frontlines. Looks like I’m finally going to see some action.</p>

                    <h2>October 31, 1932:</h2>
                    <h3>The first battle of the Great Emu War is postponed due to rain.</h3>
                    <p>Scouting parties have reported back sightings of enemy movement in the distance. We can hear the rumble of human machines approaching the front lines, but poor visibility resulting from heavy rains is making it difficult to determine the location of the encroaching human soldiers.</p>

                    <h2>November 1, 1932:</h2>
                    <h3>The emus' mobility, durability, and blind panic render them virtually immune to machine gun bullets.</h3>
                    <h4><i>"If we had a military sectionision with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds it would face any army in the world... They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks."</i></h4> 
                    <h4>-Major G.P.W. Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Artillery</h4>
                    <p>I was on watch during the early hours of the morning when the first shots rang out. Our troops were caught off guard, but our numbers were far superior. The humans began to advance on our position, but we had been preparing for this day. I commanded my team to scatter as the leaden missiles flew overhead. I watched as my commanding officer took several rounds to the breast before collapsing. In the ensuing panic, we had no choice by to retreat to a more defensible position. Despite the surprise attack by the human forces, we suffered minimal casualties.</p>

                    <h2>November 2, 1932:</h2>
                    <h3>Almost 1,000 emus escape an ambush as human forces reload. Fewer than 12 emus reported dead.</h3>
                    <h4><i>The machine-gunners' dreams of point blank fire into serried masses of Emus were soon dissipated. The Emu command had evidently ordered guerrilla tactics, and its unwieldy army soon split up into innumerable small units that made use of the military equipment uneconomic."</i></h4>

                    <p>A sortie of human soldiers and armed farmers attempted an ambush on one of the Emu brigades guarding our fallback line. Our scouts were diligent in reporting their movements, but me and many others were forced to take cover. Fortunately, my tall stature made it possible to relay the enemy’s actions to the soldiers under my command. By the early afternoon, most of the ambushed unit was able to escape unharmed. We suffered very few losses today, and my superiors have been hinting at a promotion for my actions.</p>
